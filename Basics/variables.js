// All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. 
 // These unique names are called identifiers.
// identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names(age, sum, totalVolume).
// The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers)
// are:
// Names can contain letters, digit, underscore,  and dollar signs.
// Names must begin with a letter
// Names can also begin with $ and (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
// Names are case sensitive(y and Y are different variables)
// Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names....
